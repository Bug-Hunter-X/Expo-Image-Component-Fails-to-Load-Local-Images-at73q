This solution focuses on double-checking the image path and utilizing the `require` method. 
```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const imagePath = require('./assets/myImage.jpg'); // Use require for local images

  return (
    <Image
      source={imagePath}
      style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
    />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
Also ensure that the image is correctly placed in the `assets` folder and that the path in the `require` statement accurately reflects its location relative to the component file.

This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a local URI, and the image is not displayed. The URI is correct, and the image exists in the project's assets directory.  The error message is not very informative; it might appear blank or show a generic error. This frequently happens when there's a problem with how Expo resolves the asset path, potentially due to incorrect configuration or caching issues.
